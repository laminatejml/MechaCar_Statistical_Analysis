# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to find metrics that can impact the manufacturing of the new MechaCar prototype. From here we can compare performance across manufacturer lots. 


### Hypotheses

The Null Hypothesis would be that the MechaCar is priced correctly due to good performance. The alternative hypothesis would be that the MechaCar is not favorably priced due to lesser performance in key areas.

### Testing Summary

In order to determine factors with high correlation we'd perform a multiple linear regression.
